# 01. Computer Science Basics 💻

Before we write code, we must understand the machine.
Computers are not magical. They are just really fast calculators that only know two numbers: 0 and 1.

## 1. Binary: The Language of Electricity
Why `0` and `1`?
Because a computer is made of billions of tiny switches (Transistors).
- **Switch OFF** = `0`
- **Switch ON** = `1`

We combine these creating complexity:
- `1` bit = 2 possibilities (0, 1)
- `8` bits = 1 Byte = 256 possibilities (Enough for one letter like 'A' or a shade of blue).

## 2. Abstraction: The Ladder
You don't write binary. You write Python.
This is called **Abstraction**. We build layers to hide the complexity.

1.  **Hardware**: The metal chips.
2.  **Machine Code**: 0s and 1s.
3.  **Assembly**: Move data from memory address A to B.
4.  **High-Level Languages** (Python/JS): "Print 'Hello'".

*Lesson*: Appreciate the work required to just show a pixel on the screen.

## 3. Algorithms: Recipes for Data
An **Algorithm** is just a fancy word for "A set of instructions."
- **Recipe**: Instructions to turn eggs into a cake.
- **Algorithm**: Instructions to turn a list of numbers into a sorted list.
