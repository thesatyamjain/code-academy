# 01. Foundations 🏗️

Everything starts here. Before you write code, you must understand the environment you are coding in.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand how computers process information (Binary/Data).
- [ ] Navigate your computer without a mouse (Terminal).
- [ ] Control time and history of your code (Git).
- [ ] Understand how data travels across the world (Internet/HTTP).

## 🗺️ The Path

### [1. Computer Science Basics](./01_CS_Basics.md)
- **Concept**: Bits, Bytes, and Binary.
- **Activity**: Convert the number 42 into binary.
- **Resource**: [Harvard CS50 - Week 0 (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjqgP9dpD1k)

### [2. Command Line / Terminal](./02_Terminal_Mastery.md)
- **Why?**: Graphical Interfaces are slow. The terminal is fast and powerful.
- **Commands to Master**:
    - `ls` / `dir` (List files)
    - `cd` (Change directory)
    - `mkdir` (Make directory)
    - `touch` / `echo` (Create file)
    - `rm` (Remove file - be careful!)
- **Exercise**: Create a folder structure `Universe/Galaxy/Earth` purely using the command line.

### [3. Git & GitHub](./03_Git_Version_Control.md)
- **Concept**: Version Control. It's a save button for your project history.
- **Vocabulary**: Repo, Commit, Push, Pull, Branch, Merge.
- **Exercise**:
    1. Initialize a git repo.
    2. Make a change and commit it ("First commit").
    3. Push it to a GitHub repository.

### [4. How the Internet Works](./04_How_Internet_Works.md)
- **Concepts**:
    - DNS (Phonebook of the internet).
    - HTTP/HTTPS (The language browsers speak).
    - Client vs Server.
    - IP Addresses & Ports.
- **Analogy**: Sending a letter (Data) to a house (IP) specifically to the person in the kitchen (Port).
