# 02. Terminal Mastery ⌨️

Movies show hackers typing furiously on black screens.
For once, Hollywood is right.
The **Terminal** (or Command Line) is the most powerful tool you have.

## 1. Why use it?
Using a mouse is slow. You have to find the icon, click, drag, drop.
Using the terminal is instant.
`mv *.jpg /images` -> Just moved 1,000 files in 0.5 seconds. Try doing that with a mouse.

## 2. Navigation
Think of it like a video game where you type to move.
- `pwd` (Target): "Where am I?" (Print Working Directory).
- `ls` (Look): "What is in this room?" (List).
- `cd` (Move): "Go into the 'Documents' room." (Change Directory).
- `cd ..`: "Go back out one room."

## 3. Creation & Destruction
- `mkdir Project`: "Build a room called Project."
- `touch file.txt`: "Create an empty file."
- `rm file.txt`: "Delete this file."
- `rm -rf Folder`: "Nuke this folder and everything inside it." (⚠️ Dangerous!)

## 4. The Path
- **Absolute Path**: The full address. `/Users/Jain/Documents`.
- **Relative Path**: Directions from where you are standing. `./Documents` (The folder right here).
