# 🧠 Module 08 Quiz: CS Core (Data Structures)

## Question 1: Big O Notation
You have a loop that runs inside another loop `for (i in list) { for (j in list) }`. What is the Time Complexity?
- [ ] O(1)
- [ ] O(n)
- [ ] O(n^2)
- [ ] O(log n)

## Question 2: Arrays vs Linked Lists
You need to constantly inserting new items in the *middle* of a list. Which is theoretically faster?
- [ ] Array
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue

## Question 3: Stack
A "Stack" follows which principle?
- [ ] FIFO (First In, First Out) - Like a line at a store.
- [ ] LIFO (Last In, First Out) - Like a stack of plates.
- [ ] Random Access
- [ ] Sorted Access

## Question 4: Binary Search
To use "Binary Search" (dividing the list in half repeatedly), what **must** be true about the data?
- [ ] It must be numbers.
- [ ] It must be strings.
- [ ] It must be **Sorted**.
- [ ] It must be small.

## Open Question
Why is `O(1)` (Constant Time) better than `O(n)` (Linear Time)?

1. **O(n^2)** (Quadratic)
2. **Linked List** (Because you just change the pointers, no shifting)
3. **LIFO**
4. **It must be Sorted**
