# 08. CS Core & Algorithms 🧠

The difference between a "Coder" and an "Engineer" often lies here. This is how you write EFFICIENT code.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- [ ] Measure code efficiency (Big O).
- [ ] Choose the right tool for the job (Data Structures).
- [ ] Solve complex logic problems efficiently.

## 🗺️ The Path

### [1. Big O Notation](./01_Big_O_Notation.md)
- Time Complexity: How does execution time grow as data grows?
    - `O(1)`: Instant.
    - `O(n)`: Linear (Looping through a list).
    - `O(n^2)`: Quadratic (Loop inside a loop).
- Space Complexity: How much RAM do we need?

### [2. Data Structures](./02_Data_Structures.md)
- **Arrays**: Fast lookup by index, slow insertion.
- **Linked Lists**: Fast insertion, slow lookup.
- **Stacks/Queues**: LIFO / FIFO.
- **Hash Maps / Objects**: `O(1)` lookup. Best friend of engineers.
- **Trees & Graphs**: Hierarchical data.

### [3. Algorithms](./03_Algorithms.md)
- **Sorting**: Bubble Sort (Bad) vs Merge/Quick Sort (Good).
- **Searching**: Binary Search (Divide and Conquer).
- **Recursion**: A function calling itself.
