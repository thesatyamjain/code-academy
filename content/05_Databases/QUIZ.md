# 🧠 Module 05 Quiz: Databases

## Question 1: SQL vs NoSQL
You are building a social network where the data structure changes constantly (users add new random fields). Which database is usually more flexible for this?
- [ ] SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- [ ] NoSQL (MongoDB)
- [ ] Excel
- [ ] LocalStorage

## Question 2: Primary Key
What is the purpose of a "Primary Key" in a SQL table?

- [ ] It encrypts the data.

## Question 3: ORM
What does an ORM (like Prisma or Mongoose) do?
- [ ] It makes the database faster.
- [ ] It lets you interact with the database using code (JS/Python) instead of writing raw SQL commands.
- [ ] It backs up your data.
- [ ] It creates the frontend UI.

## Question 4: Caching (Redis)
Why do we use a cache like Redis?
- [ ] To store data permanently forever.
- [ ] To store frequently accessed data in RAM so we can read it instantly, reducing load on the main database.
- [ ] To secure the data.
